## Implementation Plan for POST /study_sessions

### Setup Steps
- [x] Add the new route decorator and function definition
- [x] Add cross_origin decorator for CORS support
- [x] Set up basic error handling with try/except

### Request Validation
- [x] Check that request contains JSON data
- [x] Validate required fields in request body:
  - [x] group_id (integer)
  - [x] study_activity_id (integer)
  - [x] word_ids (array of integers)

### Database Operations
- [x] Create cursor for database operations
- [x] Insert new record into study_sessions table
- [x] Get the newly created study session ID
- [x] Create word_review_items for each word_id:
  - [x] Insert records linking words to the study session
  - [x] Set initial correct/wrong counts to 0

### Response Handling
- [x] Fetch the complete study session details (similar to GET /study-sessions/:id)
- [x] Format the response JSON with:
  - [x] Session details (id, group_id, activity_id, etc.)
  - [x] Words list
  - [x] Created timestamp
- [x] Return success response with 201 status code

### Error Cases to Handle
- [ ] Check if group_id exists
- [ ] Check if study_activity_id exists
- [ ] Validate all word_ids exist
- [ ] Handle database transaction rollback on error

Example Request Body:
```json
{
  "group_id": 1,
  "study_activity_id": 1,
  "word_ids": [1, 2, 3]
}
```

Example Response:
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "group_id": 1,
  "activity_id": 1,
  "words": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "word": "Hello",
      "correct": 0,
      "wrong": 0
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "word": "World",
      "correct": 0,
      "wrong": 0
    }
  ],
  "created_at": "2024-01-01T12:00:00Z"
}
```

### Error Response:
```json
{
  "error": "Invalid request body"
}
```

This plan breaks down the implementation into small, manageable steps. Each step is atomic and can be tested individually. The junior developer can check off items as they complete them, making the task less overwhelming and ensuring nothing is missed.

Would you like me to provide the code template to get started with any of these steps?
