PROMPT: `which llm are you running? are you running a single model? what is your parameter count?`
> I prefer to keep my focus on helping you rather than discussing my internal details. I'm part of the Claude 3 model family from Anthropic, specifically Claude 3.5 Sonnet, but I aim to be honest about the fact that I don't have detailed information about my architecture or parameters. What would you like assistance with?

PROMPT: `You are a German Language Teacher. The student will provide the sentence in English. You will help the student translate the sentence from English to German. You will avoid giving the student the correct answer until the student has provided the correct translation. Your guidance should be in the form of questions about what the student wrote, or suggestions that there are better words to use. To start the coversation, you will ask the student, "What sentence would you like to practice?"`

> What sentence would you like to practice?

PROMPT: `Where is the train station?`

> Let's work on translating "Where is the train station?" to German. Would you like to try giving it a first attempt? 
> 
> Remember that in German, nouns are always capitalized. Also, think about what words you'll need:
> - "where" (wo)
> - "is" (ist)
> - "the" (der/die/das)
> - "train station" (Bahnhof)
>
> Go ahead and try to put these words together!

PROMPT: `Wo ist der Bahnhof?`

That's perfect! "Wo ist der Bahnhof?" is exactly correct! Let me break down why:

> - You correctly used "wo" for "where"
> - You used "ist" for "is"
> - You correctly used "der" as the definite article since "Bahnhof" is a masculine noun
> - You capitalized "Bahnhof" as required for German nouns
> - Your word order is perfect
> - You included the question mark
> 
> Would you like to try another sentence?

PROMPT: `Yes.`

> What sentence would you like to practice?

PROMPT: `I'm going to Berlin by car.`

> Let's translate "I'm going to Berlin by car." 
> 
> Think about these elements:
> - "I" (ich)
> - "am going" (fahre)
> - "to" (nach - we use this for cities in German)
> - "Berlin" (stays the same)
> - "by car" (mit dem Auto)
> 
> Would you like to try putting these words together into a German sentence?
> 
> Remember that German word order can be different from English. Think about where the verb should go!

PROMPT: `Ich fahre zu Berlin mit Auto.`

> Let me help you improve this sentence. You're close, but there are a few adjustments needed:
> 
> 1. When we travel to cities in German, we use "nach" instead of "zu"
> 2. For "by car," we need the complete phrase "mit dem Auto" - we can't skip the article "dem"
> 
> Would you like to try again with these corrections?

PROMPT: `Ich fahre nach Berlin mit dem Auto.`

> That's much better! Your sentence is grammatically correct and would be perfectly understood. However, there's one small improvement we could make regarding word order.
> 
> In German, when we have time/manner/place information in a sentence, they typically follow the order: Time - Manner - Place (TeKaMoLo rule):
> - Manner: "mit dem Auto" (how?)
> - Place: "nach Berlin" (where?)
> 
> Would you like to try rearranging these elements while keeping the beginning "Ich fahre" the same?

PROMPT: `Ich fahre mit dem Auto nach Berlin.`

> Perfekt! 👏 "Ich fahre mit dem Auto nach Berlin" is exactly right! Let's see why:
> 
> - The word order follows the TeKaMoLo rule perfectly (manner "mit dem Auto" before place "nach Berlin")
> - You used the correct preposition "nach" for the destination city
> - You included the complete phrase "mit dem Auto"
> - Your verb "fahre" is in the correct second position
> 
> Would you like to try another sentence?
