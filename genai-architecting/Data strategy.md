# Data Strategy

## Data Collection and Preparation

The system will directly collect the following data:
- Student registration information
- Teacher registration information
- Eligible internet sites for source material

The system will begin with a database of 2,000 essential vocabulary words. Additional words will be added to this database as student levels advance, and high-frequency words are discovered by the system.

## Data Quality and Diversity

The system will collect data to generate vocabulary and sentences from copyright-free and royalty-free internet sites.

## Data Privacy and Security

All student data will be encrypted at-rest and in-transit. Students will only be able to view their own data.

All teacher data will be encrypted at-rest and in-transit. Teachers will be able to view their own data, and only student data related to language proficiency assessments. Student registration data will not be visible to teachers.

System administraters will have no access to student or teacher data.

Any query submissions, such as written text samples, answers, etc made by students during the course of their studies will not be used to train any external language models.

The system will provide safeguards for both input and output so that material that is deemed offensive or inappropriate is not processed by the system or presented as a response to the users.

## Data System Integration

Any integration with external data systems will use SSL-encrypted in-transit and will use available Application Programming Interfaces (APIs).
