## Business Requirements

### Business Goals and Objectives

The company currently hosts in-person German language teaching classes and private tutoring. The purpose of this project is to build a system to augment those sessions with on-demand, online learning tools. The company is currently calling this system "SprachPortal".

The company wants to build a language teaching system for their students that provides interactive exercises to enhance student learning. The company wants to build a system they control because of student privacy and learning material copyright concerns. Investment in a dedicated solution will allow the company to control the teaching methods they have developed within their system.

The company wants to tightly control costs, so is looking for a cost-effective solution that will support their current student base.

## Functional Requirements

### Teaching Functions

SprachPortal shall provide the following language teach functions within or through the system:

#### Sentence Constructor

The Sentence Constructor will generate sentences at the appropriate level for the student to translate. The student can select the topic the sentences will cover, the translation direction (English to German, or German to English) and the number of sentences for the exercise.

#### Writing Practice

The Writing Practice activity will allow the student to construct their own writing in German and the system will check the sentence for spelling and grammar correctness, and the literalism of the sentence. Ideally, the system will also recognize typical English language idioms and colloquialisms and provide suggestions for equivalent German phrases.

#### Text Adventure Immersion Game

The Text Adventure Immersion Game will generate a German "choose your own adventure"
